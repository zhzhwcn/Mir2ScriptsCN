[@Description]
Did anyone tell you about {Death Valley/Yellow}? It's a
place with lots of cliffs and rocks. The insects in
this area are growing abnormally big. I've been
researching them for years. I was trying to get a
{Specimen/LightSteelBlue} of {跳跳蜂/Crimson} a few days ago, but 
I was attacked by them.
